# Just Black + Commands

Modification of the popular pure black theme with more readable comments.

### Note

I recommend <code>"editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled": false </code>

### Support  
  
Only JavaScript is supported in the original (according to the readme.md), so if you want to add support, PR it! :)
