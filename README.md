# Just Black + Comments

![vscode with just black + comments theme and the text SP46 JUST BLACK PLUS COMMENTS superimposed on top of it](https://i.imgur.com/HFbxLPJ.png)

Modification of the popular pure black theme with more readable comments.

### Note

I recommend <code>"editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled": false </code>

### Support  
  
Only JavaScript is supported in the original (according to the readme.md), so if you want to add support, PR it! :)
